# Operations

There are several built-in actions:

{{#each actions}}
* [{{fn}}]({{name}}/README.md)
{{/each}}

To use those just import `ACTIONS` object:

```js
import { ACTIONS } from 'general-reducer';

// or

import { createGeneralReducer } from 'general-reducer';

const { ACTIONS } = createGeneralReducer(...);

...

dispatch(ACTIONS.set(...));
```

If by some reason you need action type constants, they are available as well:

```js
import { TYPES } from 'general-reducer';

// or

import { createGeneralReducer } from 'general-reducer';

const { TYPES } = createGeneralReducer(...);

...

dispatch({ type: TYPES.set, payload: ... });
```
